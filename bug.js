This bug occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API with specific camera settings, leading to unexpected behavior or crashes. The issue is particularly noticeable on older devices or when using certain image formats.  The error messages are not always clear, making debugging challenging.  For example, the camera preview may freeze, fail to start, or produce corrupted images. The exact cause can be subtle, potentially related to resource constraints or compatibility issues with the underlying camera hardware and Expo's abstraction layer.
