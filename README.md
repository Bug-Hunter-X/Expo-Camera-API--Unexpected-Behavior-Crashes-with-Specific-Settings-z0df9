# Expo Camera API Bug: Unexpected Behavior/Crashes

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug encountered when using the Expo Camera API. The bug manifests as unexpected behavior or crashes under specific conditions, such as on older devices or with particular camera settings.  The root cause is believed to be related to compatibility issues between the Expo Camera API and certain hardware configurations.

## Bug Description

The bug is characterized by the following symptoms:

* Camera preview freezing
* Camera failing to start
* Corrupted images produced
* Inconsistent behavior across devices

The provided `bug.js` file replicates the issue. The `bugSolution.js` file illustrates a potential workaround, although a more robust solution might be necessary depending on your specific needs.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run `expo start`.
4. Observe the behavior of the camera on different devices and with varied settings (e.g., resolution, image format).

## Workaround (bugSolution.js)

The workaround attempts to mitigate the issue by adding some error handling and potentially adjusting the camera settings to safer values.  However, this may not be suitable for all situations and a more permanent fix might be necessary from the Expo team.

## Additional Notes

This bug may be related to resource limitations on older devices or incompatibilities with certain camera hardware.  Further investigation is needed to identify the precise root cause.
